# Trashgram

With Trashgram people will post real efforts put into cleaning up our Earth. People will take it up as a hobby into cleaning and post it on Trashgram for likes. Trashgram deals with social networking in a unique way by making the environment as a domain of content. Trashgram neither has a bloated interface nor a pessimistic environment just like the other social media counterparts.


Trashgram's Algorithm:

1. Create a Post with Before/After pictures of the place you cleaned.
2. Look how the post performs.
3. If the post crosses the minimum bound of reach, the user will be awarded eco-points.
4. See yourself gliding up above the Leaderboard amongst your friends.
